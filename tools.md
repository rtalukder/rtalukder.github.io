# Software Tools

### API's

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of subroutine, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types. An API defines functionalities that are independent of respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising each other.

In layman's terms, an API is the messenger that takes requests and tells the system what to. Then it will return the response back to you.
